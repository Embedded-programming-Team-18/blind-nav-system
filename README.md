## Motivation

There are many assistive technologies that aid blind people navigate their enviroment. These can be in eye glasses, walking canes, helmets etc. However, the usefulness of these devices are still in debate mbecause they are usually combined with guide dogs and canes. 

Here a smart glove program is developed to tackle the navigation problem for blind people so that they can be confident to move without a cane or guide dog. 

``` **Why Smart Glove?**
1. Good for mobility as it is more compact.

2. Flexible for position of a person.

3. Ease of use than cane.

4. More range than the stick.
```

## Tech Requirements

**Hardware requirements**
    * Raspberry Pi 3
    * TFMini S LiDAR sensor
    * Servo motto controller with Arduino and 5 mottos
    * Logic Converter

**Software dependencies/frameworks used**

## Project Features

    * The LIDAR sensor(rotated by a servo motor) makes a map of 90o in front of the person.

    * According to the map and distance at which the obstacles the fingers get a feedback.

    * Using that feedback the person and get an idea of where the obstacle is located, and he can go left or right.
